# Kevoree Script (aka KevScript)

KevScript is a scripting language developed to simplify the authoring of models at design and run-time.

<span class="warning-bloc"><span class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-lg orange"></span>  KevScript is a scripting language to manipulate a model and not a general purpose langage.

The KevoreeScriptEngine takes a script and a source model as input, and returns a new model modified according to the script.</span>
