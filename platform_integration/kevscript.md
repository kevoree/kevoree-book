# KevScript Tools
## Description

In order to manipulate models, we have created a scripting language that is called **KevScript**.  
*This language is not a [general purpose language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language)*  

A KevScript engine will take a script and a model as inputs, and return a new model modified according to the script.
*In other word, KevScript is only a Kevoree-specific transformation language.*

## Implementations
The KevScript grammar is written using the **waxeye** grammar.
