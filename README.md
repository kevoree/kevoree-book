### What is ?
Kevoree project aims at enabling distributed reconfigurable software development. Build around a component model, Kevoree leverages model@runtime approach to offer tools to build, adapt and synchronize distributed systems.

### Why Kevoree ?

Adaptive systems are complex ! Even more when they are distributed !

The Models@Run.time strategy adopted by Kevoree aims at offering a clean, safer and simpler way to interact with distributed systems. Using models first, Kevoree allows users to define easly complex adaoptations to build for instance self-healing systems. Extensible, this project already offers runtime for JVM, Android, Arduino but also for virtualization management such as VirtualBox. In short Kevoree helping you to develop your adaptable software from Cloud stack to embedded devices !
