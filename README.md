### Why Kevoree?
Adaptive systems are complex! Even more when they are distributed!

The Models@Run.time strategy adopted by Kevoree aims at offering a clean, safer and simplier way to interact with distributed systems. Using models first, Kevoree allows users to define complex adaptations easily, to build for instance self-healing systems. Extensible, this project already offers runtime for JVM, Android, Arduino, Javascript but also for virtualization management such as VirtualBox. In short, Kevoree is helping you to develop your adaptable software from Cloud stack to embedded devices!

### What is it?
Kevoree project aims at enabling distributed reconfigurable software development. Build around a component model, Kevoree leverages model@runtime approach to offer tools to build, adapt and synchronize distributed systems.
