# IntelliJ

[IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an IDE, free to use (community edition), and multi-language.
In particular, it offers a very good support for Maven, making it a perfect tool for Kevoree development.

The Kevoree Plugin provides several tools to assist the development of components:

- Wizards to create a Kevoree Project, Kevoree Components, Channels and Groups
- A wizard to create a KevScript file with its editor
- A runner to launch a Kevoree Runtime of any available version, that launches using your KevScript as base configuration.

The Kevoree IntelliJ plugin sources can be found [here](https://github.com/kevoree/kevoree-idea-plugin).
